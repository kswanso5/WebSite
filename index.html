      <p>
        My name is Wade Seifert and I am a recent graduate of the University of Tennessee's Master of Public Health and Master of Nutrition programs. 
        I also attended the University of Tennessee for undergraduate where my degree was in the College Scholars Program. Following graduation, I 
        started working on local political campaigns in order to do my part in helping make Knoxville, Tennessee have representatives who put the 
        city first. I also have experience in the field of Higher education from my previous roles within the University. I am always looking for 
        ways to broaden my horizons and learn new skills as well as collaborating with community members.
      </p>
